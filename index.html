            <p class="content"><span class="bold">Neerja Bhanot</span> (7 September 1963 - 5 September 1986) was a 22 year old Indian senior flight purser on the Empress of the Seas, a Pam Am 73 hijacked at Jinnah International Airport, Karanchi by four armed men en route to Frankfurt and New York. During the 17-hour ordeal, she helped three-member cockpit crew escape in order to ground the plane so it could not be flown. Bhanot hid passports of the passengers so the hijackers could not determine passenger nationalities. She also managed to open the emergency door assisting a number of passengers to escape from the plane. Although she could have been the first to jump out of the aircraft and flee to safety when she opened the door, she decided not to and instead started helping the other passengers to escape. As the hijackers opened fire on passengers and crew, Neerja Bhanot lost her life shielding <strong>three</strong> children from bullets, just 2 days before her 23rd birthday.</p>
